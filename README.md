# IrredComplNumFinder02
A small program to visually analyze complex numbers with integer real and imaginary components for integer-valued factors.

The program searches all complex numbers with integer real and imaginary components within a configurable distance from the origin for a complete list of factor pairs (where both factors have, as well, integer real and imaginary components).
When the search is done, all analyzed complex numbers can be displayed as a grid where complex numbers with exactly / at most a configurable number of distinct factor pairs are specially marked. For each complex number in the grid, its factor pairs can be shown in the grid, where factors belonging to the same pair are marked with identical colors.
